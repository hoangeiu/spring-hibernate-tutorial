# React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project

Hi, It's me (Hoang Le), I studied the basic of Java Spring Boot framework to build APIs. And this repository contains the code of the [Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 & Hibernate for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/).
I study many new concepts in Spring Boot:

- LEARN key Spring Boot 3 features: Core, Annotations, Java Config, Hibernate/JPA and Maven.
- Spring Boot Rest APIs, Spring Boot Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST.
- Learn how to define entity and establish the relationship between them (@OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany).

Stack tech: Java + Spring Boot

### I skip chapter about Spring MVC because I think currently I only need Spring Boot to make APIs. Maybe, I will comback in the near future.

### I make a system by myself (not include in course) where I define many my own APIs to provide service for interact with my UdemyApplication ^^
